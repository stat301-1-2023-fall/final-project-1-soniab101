## Datasets

### The datasets are from this link:

The source is Fifa World Cup Archive

I am using two datasets, the World Cups dataset and the World Cup Matches dataset. The World Cups dataset contains information on the overall World Cup, with one row for each World Cup, and has variables of the year it took place, which country won, the total goals scored, and more. The World Cup Matches dataset contains information on each match played in each World Cup, and contains variables of the year it took place, the city and stadium where the match was held, home team name, and more. I have cleaned and stored the datasets.
