## Basic repo setup for final project


My project is focusing on data on the Fifa World Cup. This progress memo takes us through an introduction, data overview and quality, summary statistics, data cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and progress/conclusion. My repo also contains files that show my data cleaning, and univariate and multivariate analyses.
