## Introduction
These datasets about the FIFA World Cup are interesting to me since I enjoy watching soccer matches, especially the World Cup. One dataset contains overall information on the World Cup held every four years, and the other contains specific information about each match held in each World Cup. I believe there are many conclusions that can be drawn from this data, and many interesting questions that can be explored. Some questions I am interested in investigating are if there is any correlation between a team playing a match in their home country and whether that gives them an advantage in winning or not. I am also interested in the differences between attendance of matches.


## Data Overview & Quality
There are 20 variables in the WorldCupMatches dataset, 10 of which are categorical and 10 are numerical. There are 10 variables in the WorldCups dataset, 5 of which are categorical and 5 are numerical. After investigating the missingness of each dataset, as shown below, I saw that there was no missing data in the WorldCups dataset. However, surprisingly, I learned that a large portion of the data (81%) was shown to be missing. After reading more into this, I realized that there were many rows solely containing NA values added on to the end of the dataset, and I was able to delete these. Currently, there is only missing values for one variable (win_conditions), as shown below.

## Summary of the datasets
```{r}

st(WorldCupsCleaned, vars = c("Year","GoalsScored","QualifiedTeams","MatchesPlayed","Attendance"))

st(WorldCupMatchesCleaned, vars = 
     c("Year", "Home_Team_Goals","Away_Team_Goals", "Attendance"))
```
I wanted to investigate some summary statistics of the numerical variables in each dataset. Something that stood out to me was the wide range of the total matches played in the world cup (17 - 64) which has definitely increased over time. I was also surprised at how high the mean total attendance was at the world cups.


## Data Cleaning

# Joining Datasets
Firstly, I started out by joining my two datasets: World Cups and World Cup Matches. I looked for overlapping vars that I could use as a key to join my datasets, and decided to join them by Year since that is unique to each World Cup. I called this joined dataset Cups_Matches_Joined. After joining, I realized that further cleaning of the dataset was necessary. 

I noticed that the team name Germany was coded both as Germany and also Germany FR. After investigating the meaning of this, I realized that Germany FR was West Germany before the country was reunified. I decided to recode Germany FR as Germany, since that is how the country is considered today, and their overall world cup wins are measured for the country as a whole officially. Additionally, I parsed the Datetime variable in the World Cup Matches dataset, and turned it into a date object. Also, I renamed many of the variable names in the dataset that contained a space in them, since this can be problematic when referring to them in plotting and later code. I renamed them to use an underscore rather than a space. I needed to recode the attendance variable in the WorldCups dataset, as it was a character variable rather than a numerical one. I also realized that both the variable for World Cup total attendance in the World Cups dataset and the variable for match attendance in the World Cup Matches dataset were both named attendance, so in the joined dataset I had to rename them to total_attendance_of_WC and match_attendance respectively. 

After cleaning, I made subsets of my data as I was conducting my analysis that would help me answer my research questions. For example, in my dataset that I created called stages_attendance_df, I mutated the Stage variable so that all preliminary rounds of each World Cup, each with different names, would all be called 'Early round'. My cleaned datasets are stored in my data sub-directory as csv files. Below, I have included the first 10 rows of my joined dataset.

# Explorations

## Which team has the greatest number of World Cup titles?
First, I believed it would be best to answer an important question of which team, through 2014, has won the most World Cup titles. Figure 1 displays the distribution of World Cup wins, and provides some interesting insights. From this graph, I could conclude that Brazil is the country that has won the most World Cups this far with a total of 5 wins. Germany and Italy are tied for the second most wins with 4 each. Additionally, Argentina and Uruguay are tied at third with two wins. This helped me form some of my further questions about the data, which I investigate in the rest of this exploration.

## Attendance

I wanted to investigate the both the match attendance and overall world cup attendance variables, since I feel like they may have an interesting relationship with other variables, and could even have an effect on teams' performance during matches. 

### Distribution of Match Attendance Variable

This section helped me to answer one my main research question of interest related to the attendance: How does the attendance vary throughout the World Cups? This graph tells us the distribution of the match attendance data. We can see that the peak of the data is around 45,000 attendees, meaning that the majority of matches were attended approximately 40,000 - 50,000 people. This corresponds with the summary statistics I gathered about the data earlier in my exploration. The data is skewed right, so the majority of the data on the attendance is located on the left side of the graph. The data tapers off around 80,000 attendees meaning that matches with attendance higher than this value is quite uncommon.

### Match Attendance of Certain Countries' Teams
Next, I wanted to know how the match attendance was distributed for certain teams. I was interested to see if more people attended matches when certain countries were playing. I selected the four teams which I enjoy watching play the most, and like to keep up with the players and current team performance. I noticed that the distribution for attendance of team USA's matches has a very tall peak to the left of the other three teams, meaning frequently around 35,000 people attended their matches which is less than the average attendances for other teams. I did not find this to be too surprising, as soccer is not as popular of a sport in the US in comparison to the other three countries. Also, other major sports in the US such as American football and baseball are rivals for the US population's interest in sports. The distributions of the match attendance have significant overlap for the others countries, telling us that these other teams had a similar distribution of frequency. 

![Distribution of Match Attendance for Selected Countries](plots/match_atten_dist_favcountry_plot.png){#fig-bar3}

### Match Attendance of Top Five Countries
To build on my previous analysis of match attendance for my favorite teams, I decided to investigate the match attendance of the five countries that have won the most World Cups. Figure 4 below shows us these distributions. I was surprised to see that the distributions for all five countries were pretty similar. I found it interesting that Brazil had the highest peak out of all the teams, meaning that it had the most consistent match attendance of around 55000 people. Germany has the further right peak, telling us that they have a higher and more concentrated density, so they may consistently have better attendance. 


![Distribution of Match Attendance for Top Five Teams](plots/match_atten_dist_top5_plot.png){#fig-bar4}

### Match Attendance by the Round of the World Cup
Next, I wanted to confirm my hypothesis that the round of the World Cup has a correlation with the number of people that attend the match. Figure 5 shows us the distribution of match attendance for the different stages of the world cup, and demonstrates that the median attendance increases as we move to the next stage of the world cup. As we can see in the graph, the median attendance for early round games is around 30,000 people, while the median attendance for the final round matches is about 75,000 people. Thus, this figure supported my hypothesis that match attendance will increase in the final rounds. I was surprised to see that there were some outliers for early round matches with attendances even greater than 150000. This may be due to the popularity of the team playing, or the location of the match.


![Match Attendance vs World Cup Round](plots/stages_atten_plot.png){#fig-bar5}


### Total Attendance of World Cups Over the Years
Next, I wanted to look at the attendance through a wider lens by exploring the overall total attendance of World Cups.
From Figure 6 below, I was able to see that the total attendance has greatly increased over the years since 1930, from around 600,000 attendees to 3,300,000. This upward slope indicates a growth in total attendance over the years, which could be due to the tournament gaining more attention and popularity over the years as more teams began participating in it leading to more matches being played. Additionally, there were peaks around 1950 and 1998, indicating years where there was a sharp increase in attendance. I believe this could be due to factors such as host country popularity, or exciting match lineups. 

![Total Attendance at Each World Cup ](plots/years_atten.png){#fig-bar6}

### World Cup Attendance For Each Host Country
My exploration of the trend in overall World Cup attendance motivated me to investigate how the World Cup attendance varies depending on the host country. I was especially interested in seeing which countries could have been hosting the World Cup during the years of peak attendance that we saw in Figure 6. Figure 7 below represents this investigation, by showing us the relationship between the two variables. I was surprised to see that the World Cup hosted by USA had the highest attendance out of all the World Cups thus far, especially since we learned in our earlier analysis that match attendance was lower for team USA in comparison to Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. I believe this may be due to the USA's larger population, resulting in a larger turnout when the tournament is hosted closer. It was also interesting to see that the next 3 countries with the highest attendance are Brazil (when they hosted the second time in 2014), Germany (2006), and South Africa. I did not expect South Africa to have such a high World Cup attendance. It was interesting to see the large increase between the first and second time that certain countries hosted the World Cup.

## Goals Scored
Next, I wanted to investigate the variables documenting the Goals Scored, both by teams in individual matches and the total goals scored in the overall World Cup. I figured this would be a good metric to measure the performance of different teams. 

### Distribution of Total Goals per World Cup
First, I looked at the distribution of the total goals scored in each World Cup to see how it varies. From figure 8 below, we can see that the data forms an interesting shape, as it is not in the shape of a bell curve, but is still symmetrical. I determined that most frequently, the total number of goals scored in a World Cup is between about 85-95 or 140-150 goals. I also found it surprising that it was equally infrequent to have the total goals be between 105-115 goals and 150-160 goals. I believe that the World Cups with a lower amount of total goals were probably earlier on when there were fewer teams that played in the tournament. Over the years, the number of teams played has increased, and maybe the skill level of the players is also greater causing the recent World Cups to have a higher total number of goals. 


![Distribution of Total Goals Scored per World Cup](plots/totalgoals_plot.png){#fig-bar8}

### Total Goals Scored in the World Cup Over Time
After looking at the previous figure, I decided it would be interesting to look at how the total goals scored in each World Cup has changed over time. Figure 9 below provides some interesting insights about the trends in goals scoring. We can clearly see that over the years, the total goals scored per World Cup has greatly increased. I was surprised to see that there were steep peaks and valleys at certain years. I was especially surprised to see the steep increase of about 50 goals from the World Cup of 1950 to the World Cup of 1954, and then the sharp decrease in the following years. Maybe the World Cup of 1954 had specific high-performing teams that participated, or memorable matches that produced a unusually high number of goals. 



![Total Goals Scored in the World Cup Over Time](plots/years_goals_scored.png){#fig-bar9}

### Total Goals of Select Teams for Recent World Cups
Next, I decided to explore different teams' performance in the recent World Cups, using their total goals scored as a measure of their performance. Firstly, I wanted to look at the performance of the teams I enjoy watching the most: Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and USA. There appears to be a trend of consistent increase in Germany's performance through the World Cups, as they scored a total of about 8 goals in 1994, and a total of about 28 goals in the 2014 World Cup. I was surprised by Argentina's performance in 2002, as they only scored 2 goals that year. USA consistently performed the worst out of the 6 teams, scoring less than the other three teams every year other than 2002 where they scored higher than Argentina. 


![Teams' Total Goals for the Recent World Cups](plots/countrygoals_recentWC_myfav_plot.png){#fig-bar10}

### Total Goals of Top Five Teams for Recent World Cups 
The previous investigation led me to explore another pressing question I had: 
How have the top scoring countries’ performance change over time? Figure 11 below illustrates the total number of goals scored in the six recent World Cups by the five countries that have won the most World Cups overall. I found it very interesting how Uruguay, despite having won two World Cups, did not participate in the 1994,1998, or 2006 World Cups, and only scored 4 goals in the 2002 and 2014 World Cups. They performed better, however, in the 2010 World Cup, scoring a total of 11 goals. Germany had the highest scoring record out of these teams in 5 out of 6 of these World Cups, with Brazil having a higher total in 2002. I was surprised to see that Brazil did not outscore Germany in terms of goals in these World Cups even though Brazil has won the most World Cups (5 so far) overall. This may be because Brazil played against highly skilled opponents during these tournaments.

# Progress and Conclusion
I believe I have made great progress in my exploration and analysis of this data, and have gained insights into the relationships between different variables. After investigating the data, I was able to determine which variable names and values needed cleaning, and made the data a lot more organized. Additionally, I learned more about variables such as attendance and goals scored, and how these variables have changed over time. This has helped guide me towards forming my overall research questions, which relate to learning about how the attendance of World Cup matches varies based on which country the match is held in.


# Conclusion 

The FIFA World Cup has greatly increased in relevance and popularity over the years, becoming a huge tournament where many teams from all over the world participate and attract millions of viewers and attendees. World Cup matches are attended by tens of thousands of people each year, with a mean attendance of about 45,000 people. I concluded that the match attendance does vary based on certain factors such as which teams are playing and what round of the World Cup we are in. For instance, team USA's matches frequently attract a lower number of attendees (around 35,000 people) than teams like Germany and Brazil. Additionally, as I expected, my analysis supported the fact that there is a positive correlation between match attendance and the stage of the world cup we are in. The median match attendance increased as we moved from the early rounds to the quarter finals, third place, semi-finals, and the finals.

I also learned a lot about the overall total attendance of World Cups through my analysis. Looking at the trend in total World Cup attendance over the years (from 1930 - 2014), I saw that the overall attendance has increased greatly over the years from around 600,000 people in 1930 to 3,300,000 people in 2014. This is definitely attributed to more teams participating in the tournament throughout the years resulting in a large increase in the number of matches played. Additionally, the world population has greatly increased since the time of the first World Cup. Still, however this information about the trend in overall attendance demonstrates the great increase in attention and popularity the World Cup has gained over the years, and the steep peaks in attendance produce thought provoking questions regarding what could have caused the spikes in attendance. I was able to find some answers to my questions regarding how the World Cup attendance varies based on which country it is hosted in. For example, I concluded that the World Cup hosted in 1994 in USA had the highest total attendance overall, with about 3.6 million attendees. I found this surprising because I did not realize that soccer was so popular of a sport in America. Brazil and Germany had the second and third highest attendances, respectively, which was less surprising to me since these countries are well known for having very strong soccer teams.   

I was able to learn more about the performance of different teams in the World Cups through the total number of goals variable. Looking at the total goals per country for the six recent World Cups, I was not too surprised to see USA's low performance in comparison to teams like Germany and Brazil since the soccer is not as popular of a sport in USA as it is in these other countries. I was interested by the trend of consistent increase in Germany's performance through the World Cups, especially by the high total of about 28 goals they had in the 2014 World Cup. I found it surprising that although Uruguay holds two World Cup titles, they did not participate in 1994, 1998, or 2006 World Cup, and have not performed as strongly as other teams who hold World Cup titles. 

If I were to continue exploring this dataset, I would want to continue to look at the relationships between different variables and goals scored to see how different variables relate to countries' performances in the tournament. I would also want to investigate more into the variables of winner, runner-up, third, and fourth to see how these rankings have changed over time, or which countries consistently make the top 4 rankings. It would also be interesting to explore the geographical distribution of the winners, and even create a map highlighting how the winning countries are distributed around the world. These further explorations could provide valuable insights into how the popularity of soccer and team performance varies depending on which part of the world we look at.
